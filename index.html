				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<h5>student <span>& gamer</span></h5>
				<p>I was born and raised in a country called Libya in its capital city Tripoli located in the middle top of Africa . I was raised a Muslim in a middle eastern culture environment where everyone is named muhammed and everyone warns you not to eat pork, our main language was Arabic until I moved to Australia in 2011 to where I am today writing this assignment. As you can imagine it was a big transition coming to an entirely different country and having to learn a completely new language, It was such a mix I would end up speaking a sentence in half arabic and half English and sometimes I still do it till this day. I have finished primary school and high school which sums up to 12 years of schooling/hell. growing up I loved playing video games which started on a original ps2 playing gta San Andreas and god of war, till getting introduced to a ps3 and playing one of the most popular games of all time call of duty black ops 2 and the last of us, from there its always been gaming, constantly wasting mass amounts of money on games consoles and finally my own hand built pc, I eventually got so good at games I could get decently good at any game in about a hour or so of gametime. I also enjoyed playing football/soccer growing up and played for Preston lions. my first and most favorite pet was my kitten Tora. She saw herself as an apex predator and when she looked at herself in the mirror, she saw a tiger. She would literally bring me prey such a bird to prove her worthiness.

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
				<p> ideal job is a software developer. It includes writing, developing and designing software or code that either does something on its own or wait for someone to come tell it what to do and sculpting it to a point where it is understandable and appealing to a human being.
this position includes being a software developer who programs and designs a virtual assistant which is needed to be integrated into student portals and the university website. They require the software developer to be very experienced and have high expertise in google cloud and core programming languages such as java wants this virtual assistant to be the main access point for students to obtain all the key services they require, so this virtual assistant will need very detailed code. They also want the software developer to work with other stakeholders such as data engineers closely in order to build the best result possible which requires teamwork and communication skills. This job (software development) is appealing to me because its making something come to life digitally. A virtual assistant which will be used or accessed by over 70000 students is amazing. Making a program that successfully runs and responds to the users answers or inputs and does what it is told to do is so interesting to me, This job fits this perfectly.

<p>This job application requires a software developer who is experienced in writing code and has expertise in not just 1 programming language but the core programming languages. They need someone who has major experience constructing software and has excellent project management skills. They also need teamwork and communication skills in order to build the absolute best software possible with shared knowledge.
My skills and qualifications include basic knowledge of python and entry level information on IT and web development. I currently am working on my programming language expertise and will gain more communication and teamwork skills for assignment 2 and 3 group projects during this semester which will be helpful for this job application as they need multiple people to work on one project.
In order for me to gain the appropriate knowledge and skills for this job I will need to complete my bachelor of IT and continue building my teamwork and communication skills during class by participating and taking more action in group activities to boost these skills. I don’t have the up to date qualifications for this job but after this degree and some work experience I should be able to achieve this goal. I plan to use my degree to gain the appropriate experience in software development and working alongside other software developer to gain teamwork and communication skills.</p>

				<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
				<p>My test results conclude that I am a very self-conscious and introverted person. This test to me shows that I am rather shy or afraid to approach people. It tells me that I am more of a sole, independent worker instead of being in a team environment. I need to change this and improve myself in team environments in order to obtain the best results not only as a software developer but as an IT specialist in general.
these test results give a general direction of the person I am to help not only employers but for me to see what areas aim excelling at and what needs to be improved. All 3 tests taken lean on the fact that I am a little introverted which may be a difficult obstacle for me as I need to work in a group for my assignments. I may not participate or be to afraid to give feedback or ask questions.
If I do not participate in my groups and not put my opinions out there may put my team behind or lack information to help them. I should take these into account when working with my team by putting myself out there and doing the things im afraid to do, like getting to know people and joining in conversation in order to not let my team down and work to the best of my ability.
<p>Personality type: Defender (ISFJ-T)
<p>Traits: Introverted – 91%, Observant – 51%, Feeling – 52%, Judging – 65%, Turbulent – 78%
Role: Sentinel</p>
<p>Strategy: Constant Improvement</p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				<p> IT will always have a place in my life. My interest in IT first started as I gained maturity and age when I realized that IT is so deeply engraved in our life that we do not notice it often. My love for IT got ignited and launched into space once I first built my own personal computer. I bought all the parts myself, learned about all the components their speeds, what the hell a ryzen 5800x cpu 3.8 ghz clocked to 4.9ghz does and why RAM sticks ram information so quickly. This experience magically opened curiosity holes in my brain making me think,
					<p>how do computers communicate?</p>
					<p>how do they know what to do?</p>
					<p>What languages do they speak?</p>
					<p>how? Why? What?</p>
					<p>Why does this link specifically take so long to load?</p>
<p>What makes my computer connect to the internet?</p>
<p>How does my graphics card display this gibberish on my screen?
<p>
After this spark, it led me to further research I learnt skills on HTML and CSS through YouTube and websites, which led to me to another whole different aspect of IT, the Cybersecurity Aspect. This made me fall even more in love with IT and programming and all the fun little things of IT. I taught myself how to use virtual machines and set up my own linux machine using virtual box, I played around with all the open-source tools that come with linux too such as

				<h2>My Project Idea</h2>
				<h3>OverView</h3>
				<p>My project idea consists of a mirroring application, where the user chooses what device he would like to mirror and be able to control that device on any other device that the user may have. This could be a personal computer being accessed and used with a mobile phone or vice versa. Users of this mirroring application will be able to have full control over other devices remotely from any location only if both devices are kept online and connected to the internet. This mirroring application will be a programmed software that will be available across all core operating systems.
				</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>on average, there are 25 connected devices in a home in Australia according to many statistics. Imagine if a person had access to all 25 devices with just 1 device using them to their full potential all from one device remotely. Not only will these make his devices easily accessible, but will make managing, working or entertainment way simpler. A user may require a top spec personal computer for his intense gaming session he is in dire need of, but he is currently 1000km away from it having a holiday, they could simply boot up his secondhand laptop that he brought with him to watch Netflix on and boot up the mirroring software to play his favorite games as if he was on it.

				</div>
				<h3></h3>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>
					The software will be free to download for everybody, however profit will be made through advertising. This can be waived by purchasing the “premium” version of the software which eliminates all advertisements. User data will also be taken and stored and possibly sold to other companies if it is profitable. The software will include a account setup where users can log in with their emails or create a new account. Through their account they can track the devices they have recently mirrored to. They can also see which devices have this software logged in to so it can be easier for connections to be made. The software will automatically detect what device the user wants to remotely control and will have a passcode and or a security protocol to protect the users devices, however this is up to the user. The security protocol will need to be passed in all sensitive processes such as bank transfers or account log ins, for example a user logging in to his PayPal account remotely, this will trigger the software to either ask for a passcode or a 2 factor authentication from the user depending on the user choice of security protocol. The application will act as a main hub for all user devices, almost like a home screen for all his devices. The user can check the battery levels and Wi-Fi connection speeds on all devices to make sure they keep a remote connection. This software can also allow users to open cameras on laptops or webcams on their own devices as well, this can prove further useful as they can use this software as a surveillance system for their devices or the device location. Furthermore, this mirroring application can also allow the user to give permission or access to device technicians or troubleshooters to remotely access your devices and diagnose it remotely to see what the issue is before they quote you a price for a fix. The software performance will depend on the users internet speed and hardware he is using, if the users internet speeds are slow, he will have a hard time connecting and accessing devices, however in this day and age most home and public internet speeds are very good and will be excellent with this software. This mirroring application can also help users track their devices or even protect it from theft. Any unauthorized access on the device such as the users laptop has been opened and he has not authorized someone to open it, the software will alert the user of the activity immediately and the user can implement automatic procedures for when this kind of problem happens. Users of this application can also implement automatic connectivity of known devices or can choose to connect manually. The best feature of this software is its simplicity and effectiveness, this application will be programmed and designed to be easily understandable, simple buttons and simple tools for experienced and non-experienced users. This software will also include a “advanced” setting where experienced users can play around with different options and change the software options to their liking.
				</p>
				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				<p>
					the software will be programmed in C++, similar to TeamViewer remote software. The reason for this being a fast responsive code in terms of execution and compilation as well is its easy use. The average internet speed is needed for connectivity nothing too fast is needed. It will also be created using SDK (software development kit) as well as a text editor, compilers, linkers and debuggers. All of these will help draft, create and fix and mistakes in the code if needed and help anyone who is looking at the software source code understand the code and be able to give feedback. This software can be downloaded on any device with a operating system this includes phones and big computers, even smart tv’s can be connected
				</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>
If the project is successful, a new innovative way of managing devices will be spread across the globe. One device can now act as 20 other devices with a simple software download. People including big companies and business around the world will now be able to manage multiple electronic devices on a single device of their choice with ease. It would be widely popular, and all kinds of people would see this software as a need whether you’re a student/teacher or professional or even just a ordinary person who enjoys the features of this software. Management of multiple devices has never been easier and that’s with the added security and monitoring.
